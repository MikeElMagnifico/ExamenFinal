          <p>The music on this album is great-- Funky [Tickets, Ladykiller], rap-ish [Payphone, Beautiful Goodbye], dance-y [Lucky Strike], but it doesn't really rock out. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the lyrics get old after a while. Are mushy love songs all Adam Levine can write about? Even the least lovey song, Lucky Strike, still sings about his love... just partying with her. Adam, you need to be creative... "Surf Wax America" by Weezer is a song about surfing. "Counting Stars" by OneRepublic is about seeing the world. Even though I hate it, at least "The Phoenix" by Fallout Boy is about a war. Doesn't he ever get tired of writing ONLY love songs?
            And about the bonus tracks, well, they just sound weird.
            In conclusion, this is a great album, but Adam Levine needs to show how creative he can be. However the album artwork looks very interesting, that I can say the least. I'd also recommend "Hands All Over" [M5 album from 2011].</p>

            <p>Is it Songs About Jane: 10th Anniversary Edition? No, but then It Won't Be Soon Before Long [CD/DVD] [Deluxe Edition] wasn't either - that was a massively slick and poppy album and I adored it. So why was I reading all of these negative reviews that kept me from buying it as soon as it came out? Maybe I was worried with Jesse's departure, they had gone off the deep end like all the reviews were making it out to be. Overexposed belongs in the same catalog with all of their previous albums. Maroon 5 has from the start been the band with the stellar hooks, extremely catchy, get under your skin and stuck in your head. They've also become very known for upbeat, fast songs with more depressing lyrics - this hasn't changed either, so I'm lost where people think this has strayed so far from their formula? The main drive of Maroon 5 has always, ALWAYS, been Adam's amazing vocal ability with Jesse's keyboards a very close second. I've listed to it only once and the majority of the songs have caught my attention on the first listen, so I know with repeated listens this will easily overtake Hands All Over (Amazon MP3 Deluxe Exclusive Version) to be up there with SAJ and IWBSBL.</p>

              <p>I read some not so positive reviews about this CD before I purchased, but I'm SOOOOO glad I didn't let those reviews stop me from making my own determination. Sometimes music isn't always about what you're used to, or what accolades the past music has received, but THIS is what music is all about, IMO. I've listened to this to and from work, at work (when no one is around - wink, wink), and it's filling up my house right now. There's nothing boring about this CD. Every song has it's own beat, it's message, while it may not be deep and life changing for some, I find that I'm moving to every song. I catch myself grooving in my car on my way to work, and if I were to get stopped - it would definitely be for "distracted driving" (LOL) I sure wouldn't complain if I were standing 'in the middle of Hollywood Blvd' while Adam 'wipes my eyes.' I bought this CD for one song, initially - "One More Night" but that has quickly changed. If you can't relate to "Sad" at one point in your life than you're either arrogant or you're too young to understand. My new favorite! Did I mention I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CD? Give it a try and just let it play!</p>
